#### **About This Repo:**
##### The original concept was to build something modern and contemporary that suits the business model for Zimmerle Eats' ideas. What resulted was a very expressive yet polished design that accurately corresponds with entrepreneurial goals.

##### **Features:**
* ##### *Sophisticated design concept that uses React/NextJS and styled with Cirrus CSS/UI*  
* ##### *Interactive page components that both encourages and engages the users experience within* 
* ##### *Captivating product imagery that entices the customer to purchase the services rendered*

##### [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started) 
##### [Cirrus CSS](https://www.cirrus-ui.com/docs)
